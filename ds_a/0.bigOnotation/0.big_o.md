# BIG O

An Algorithm is **O(f(n))** if the number of simple operations the computer has to do
is eventually less than a constant times **f(n)**, as **n** increases.

- **f(n)** could be LINEAR (f(n) = n)
- **f(n)** could be CUADRATIC (f(n) = n\*\*2)
- **f(n)** could be CONSTANT (f(n) = 1)
- **f(n)** could be something different == LOGs

```javascript
function addUpToMath(n) {
  return (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
}

// This has 3 operations so it's O(1) - constant
```

```javascript
function addUpToFor(n) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    total += i;
  }
  return total;
}

// Number of operations is bounded by a multiple of n i.e. 10n
// O(n)
```
